That continued to be the ceiling price for such hose until October 22, 1942. -On October 20, 1942, at 5:04 p. m. the Price Administrator filed with the Division of the Federal Register a new order known as Maximum Price Regulation No. 95, reducing the maximum price on that type of hose to $1.65 effective October 22, 1942.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">2</a> Presumably the new regulation took effect at 12:01 a. m. on October 22, 1942, or for practical purposes, at the beginning of business hours that day. Plaintiff presented herself at the shop of defendant on October 22 at approximately noon. (Defendant insists it was during the forenoon.) She purchased of defendant a pair of nylon hose of the gauge and denier covered by the order of October 20, and paid therefor the sum of $2.50, or 85 cents more than the new ceiling price. She asked for and was given a receipt. On the following day, October 23, 1942 she filed suit in the Small Claims Branch of the Municipal Court, demanding $50 for the alleged violation. Defendant testified that she had no notice whatever of the new and lower ceiling price and in fact did not receive notice of it until three days after the sale and two days after she had been served with process in the case. She also testified that shortly before that time her father had died and that at the very time she was making the sale her husband was in the shop speaking on the telephone to a doctor concerning certain papers in connection with her father’s estate. Her husband corroborated this testimony. After hearing the case in part, the trial judge continued it in order to obtain testimony as to whether the stockings were actually of the grade and quality which fell within the new $1.65 price limit. After the stockings had been examined by an expert of the Office of Price Administration, testimony was offered to the effect that they were in fact of the gauge and denier which had been reduced in'price to $1.65 by the order of October 20, 1942. The record is silent as to what method if any had been adopted by the Price Administrator for giving notice of price changes put into effect by his orders.</p>

    <p id="b749-9" data-blocks='[["BL_749.7",749,[872,1061,743,830]]]'>The contention of the Price Administrator is that the trial judge committed error in limiting plaintiff’s recovery to the eighty-five cent overcharge because he was without discretion in the matter and was required under the Act to grant judgment for $50. The section (205(e) of the Act upon which he relies is, in its applicable parts, as follows: “If any person selling a commodity violates a regulation, order, or price schedule prescribing a maximum price or maximum prices, the person who buys such commodity for use or consumption other than in the course of trade or business may bring an action either for $50 or for treble the amount by which the consideration exceeded the applicable maximum price, whichever is the greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the court * *</p>

What does this language mean? Did Congress intend that every overcharge, whether intentional or otherwise, must be regarded as a violation ? Can it be said that every shopkeeper who makes an overcharge whether in good faith or bad, with or without knowledge (or even an opportunity for knowledge) of a change in a price regulation, must forfeit $50 (or more when treble the overcharge amounts to more) ? Does it mean <a id="p702" href="#p702" data-label="702" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*702</a>that the courts are completely divested of discretion and must automatically grind out judgments for $50 in every such case? We think not. The statute merely provides that the plaintiff “may bring an action”, etc. An “action” is merely a form of suit by which a plaintiff presents to a court for its determination his demand for money.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">4</a> To “bring an action” has a settled, familiar legal, as well as general meaning. It is synonymous with “commencing a suit”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">5</a> It is the means by which the judicial machinery is set in motion. It is but the commencement of the suit — the <em>first </em>step by which the judicial machinery is set in motion. It is conclusive of nothing. It constitutes notice to the defendant that he has the right and is required to defend himself against the charge. The plaintiff's claim as well as the defense are then submitted to a court or jury, the facts are weighed and the law considered and there follows a judicial determination of the rights of the parties, and whether the “action” has been sufficiently proven to entitle plaintiff to judgment.</p>

It is in essence a statutory sanction written into the Act to encourage consumer-actions. Thus it amounts to a penalty without reference to the actual amount of damage<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">6</a> and is not different from a forfeiture in money.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

In other words Congress by appropriate language could have taken the question of the amount of recovery out of the realm of discretion and fixed it arbitrarily as the amount for which judgment would have to be rendered in every case of violation. It is significant that Congress did no such thing in framing this legislation. It is even more significant that Congress had previously prescribed such mandatory recovery in at least one comparable situation, namely, in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> There Congress provided that any employer violating the provisions enacted by underpaying an employee <em>"shall be liable </em>to the employee or employees affected in the amount of [their] unpaid minimum wages, or [their] unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, <em>amd in an additional equal amount as liquidated </em>damages."

Congress said that the court was to have only two functions, (1) to determine whether there had been an underpayment and if so how much and (2) to add 100 percent to that amount as the unvarying and un-variable amount of the plaintiff’s judgment. The courts have several times construed such language to be mandatory and not discretionary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> In one of the cases the rule was tersely stated as follows: “Right <a id="p703" href="#p703" data-label="703" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*703</a>to the liquidated damages arises automatically with a finding of unpaid overtime compensation. <em>Because of the explicit statement by Congress that ‘an additional equal amount (shall be allowed) as liquidated </em>damages/ <em>the courts are given no discretion </em>in deciding whether they should form part of the recovery.” (Italics supplied.)

    <p id="b751-4" data-blocks='[["BL_751.5",751,[100,637,745,792]]]'>The language used in the statute under consideration is very different in its practical application. Unlike the Fair Labor Standards Act, this Act in authorizing the filing of consumer-actions merely formulates the manner in which a plaintiff may compute his claim, and the maximum <em>for zvhich he may sue. </em>It stops short of saying that the defendant “shall be liable” for the amount claimed. Viewed in a reasonable light, we think it does not mean, as the Price Administrator contends, that every shopkeeper who makes an overcharge of even a few cents must forfeit $50 to every customer who decides to sue. If that were so a small shopkeeper could unwittingly put himself out of business in a few minutes by making a series of small overcharges, however innocent his intentions.</p>

We do not think Congress intended any such sweeping punitive measure, for it would actually serve to defeat one of the very purposes of the Act which is stated in the preamble, “to prevent hardships to persons engaged in business.” Section 1.</p>

They would not be heard to say that the overcharge had been made innocently or without notice or opportunity of notice of the order. They would not be allowed to explain the difficulty of interpreting such an order or determining whether a particular price schedule applied to a particular article of merchandise.

This belief is confirmed by other recent legislation of a somewhat similar nature. The provisions of the Fair Labor Standards <a id="p705" href="#p705" data-label="705" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*705</a>Act, fixing minimum wages and maximum hours and giving an employee the right to recover liquidated damages from an employer violating its provisions, provided that the minimum wage and maximum hours provisions should “take effect upon the expiration of one hundred and twenty days from the date of enactment of this Act.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">3</a> The District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act, fixing maximum rent ceilings and minimum service standards and permitting a tenant to bring an action against the landlord violating those provisions, made such provisions effective “on and after the thirtieth day following the enactment of this Act.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">4</a> If Congress deemed it necessary and advisable in the passage of the acts cited to allow a period of time between the dates of the enactment and the effective dates of the provisions of the acts in order that the people have time and opportunity to acquaint themselves with their provisions and thus be enabled to take precautions necessary to prevent their violations and consequent penalties or damages, then it seems to me that Congress must have intended that retailers have a reasonable time to acquaint themselves with the changes in price schedules before they are deemed violators of the changed schedules. The consideration of the acts prior to enactment attracted much public attention and discussion and their passage became known generally almost immediately, but there was not that same public discussion, if indeed any, prior to this particular change of price schedule.

The act of the defendant in this case was done in complete ignorance of the changed schedule, and, therefore, it seems to me neither ■ good faith nor bad faith could be exercised, that is, that the'question of good or bad faith arises only when there is notice or opportunity to acquire notice.</p>
