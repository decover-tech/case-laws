    <p id="b929-28" data-blocks='[["BL_929.29",929,[912,1562,746,542]]]'>This appeal is taken from the decision of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia sitting as a three judge court in the hearing of an application for the review of an order of the Administrator of Rent Control for the District of Columbia, a proceeding authorized by the District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act of December 2, 1941.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> That court held that the application for review was premature, dismissed the appeal, and remanded the case to the Administrator for further proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b929-29" data-blocks='[["BL_929.30",929,[912,2115,744,247]]]'>The petition for review was filed by appellant, who is the owner of an apartment building located in the District of Columbia.

These petitions were consolidated for hearing and referred <a id="p882" href="#p882" data-label="882" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*882</a>to an examiner as provided by Section 8 of the Rent Act. The petitions were heard by the examiner. He recommended orders fixing maximum rent ceilings, which were served upon the parties as provided by Paragraph (c) of Section 8. We do not pass upon the question argued on this appeal whether the examiner made findings of fact as that is immaterial to our decision.</p>
    <p id="b930-4" data-blocks='[["BL_930.5",930,[233,696,744,404]]]'>Section 8 provides that any party may within five days after service of the recommended order request its review by the Administrator. If no such request is made within five days the order automatically becomes the order of the Administrator with the reservation that the Administrator may on his own motion review the proceedings at any time within ten days after such service.</p>
    <p id="b930-5" data-blocks='[["BL_930.6",930,[231,1121,745,530]]]'>It is admitted that these respondents did not request a review of the examiner’s order within five days from the service thereof, and that the Administrator did not review the proceedings within ten days as authorized by this section. However, certain other tenants against whom the petitions under Section 4 had been filed, which petitions were heard by the examiner with those filed against the respondents, did within five days request a review by the Administrator of the recommended order as it affected their cases.</p>

Each of these sub-sections authorizes a petition by the landlord, or by the tenant, or in sub-section (a) by either, upon specifically stated grounds. This part of each sub-section terminates with a semicolon. Each sub-section then continues with the statement — “whereupon the Administrator may by order adjust” etc. The only orders specifically authorized to be entered by the Administrator in Section 4 are these orders definitely determining and fixing, pursuant to the proceedings therein prescribed, new rent ceilings or adjusted minimum service requirements. Such orders are in their nature final, and under the requirements of Section 8 must be made after hearing testimony by an examiner.</p>

This limits the review to an order of the Administrator “made pursuant to Section 4 of this Act [section 45-1604]”. The expressions “pursuant to” or “in pursuance of” have a restrictive interpretation. They have been regarded as equivalent to “in conformity with” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and imply that what is done is in accordance with an instruction or direction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
