Lyon in the sum of $1974 for goods and services. With the complaint was filed an affidavit by an agent of the plaintiff, averring that the defendant was a non-resident of the District of Columbia and was a resident of Rockville, in the State of Maryland; and a writ of attachment before judgment was issued. The attachment was served upon a local bank and funds on deposit there to the credit of the defendant were seized. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion to quash the writ of attachment alleging he was a resident of the District, and later filed an answer denying any indebtedness to the plaintiff. Oral testimony was taken <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>on the issue raised by the motion to quash and after hearing the trial court entered an order granting the motion. This appeal is from the order granting the motion to quash the attachment. It is an appealable order.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b696-4" data-blocks='[["BL_696.4",696,[238,536,749,833]]]'>The evidence at the hearing was to the effect that defendant is a physician, with an established office in the District of Columbia where he has been practicing his profession since 1925; that he is a member of various District of Columbia medical societies, a former director of a District of Columbia hospital, a member of the medical board of another District hospital and a director of a District bank; that in 1926 he acquired a farm of some 150 acres located near Rockville, Maryland, improved by a spacious dwelling house which has been listed as his residence until recent times; that at the Maryland residence defendant had four automobiles, all registered in Maryland; and defendant when required to register under the Selective Service Act registered in Rockville, Maryland.</p>

When he moved to the apartment he partly furnished it with furniture brought from the Maryland residence and the remaining furniture at the Maryland residence was put in storage; the Maryland residence was boarded up, the telephone suspended subject to restoration, and defendant has not since occupied the residence, even on week ends. He brought one of his automobiles to the District and operated it here under Maryland registration until) the bringing of this action, when he registered it in the District.</p>

On cross-examination, he admitted he and his family lived in an apartment in the District of Columbia for the winter of 1940. An agent of the plaintiff testified that it had been making clothes for the defendant for some twelve years, delivering the clothes to the defendant sometimes at his office in the District and at other times at his residence in Maryland.</p>
    <p id="b696-18" data-blocks='[["BL_696.8",696,[1015,599,753,1165]]]'>The sole basis for the attachment is the alleged non-residence of defendant.

His home, for the time being, was the apartment, regardless of the fact he had residential property in Maryland to which he probably intended returning at some indefinite time. Whether he moved to the District because of the servant problem and gas rationing, as plaintiff suggests, and intends to return to Maryland sometime in the future when he can “afford to go back,” as his testimony suggests, it is evident for <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>the time being he has quit his Maryland residence and established a fixed abode in the District.
