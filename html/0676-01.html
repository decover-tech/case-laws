    <p id="b724-25" data-blocks='[["BL_724.28",724,[1026,2144,751,369]]]'>On June 28, Í939 appellee purchased from appellant certain premises in Takoma Park, Maryland. A written contract of sale of that date provided in part: “that assessments for improvements completed prior to the date hereof, whether assessment thereon has been levied or not, shall be paid by the seller or allowance made therefore at the time of transfer.”</p>
    <p id="b724-26" data-blocks='[["BL_724.29",724,[1025,2534,749,79]],["BL_725.1",725,[127,291,750,578]]]'>It is conceded that prior thereto improvements consisting of water main and sewer, <a id="p677" href="#p677" data-label="677" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*677</a>had been completed by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. Under Maryland law the cost of this improvement is imposed upon the property as a benefit charge and constitutes a lien thereon. Baker v. Smith &amp; Gottlieb, Inc., App.D.C., <a href="/f2d/132/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="132 F.2d 18" data-case-ids="1265996" data-case-paths="/f2d/132/0018-01">132 F.2d 18</a> decided November 30, 1942. It could have been discharged in the present instance (at the time of the transfer) by a payment of $421.44; otherwise it must be paid in annual installments of $17.68 over a period-of fifty years, the increase in amount representing interest cumulated and prorated.</p>
    <p id="b725-4" data-blocks='[["BL_725.4",725,[125,890,748,365]]]'>When the transaction of sale was closed and the property transferred to the purchaser the seller did not pay or make allowance for this assessment. Thereafter he disclaimed liability. Appellee then instituted an action, No. 397,249, in the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia, claiming the sum of $421.44 for breach of the contract.</p>
    <p id="b725-5" data-blocks='[["BL_725.5",725,[123,1276,749,165]]]'>That action was tried by the court without a jury. It resulted in a general finding and judgment for the plaintiff on September 19, 1941 for the sum of $17.36.</p>
    <p id="b725-6" data-blocks='[["BL_725.6",725,[122,1453,749,200]]]'>Appellee filed a motion for new trial, alleging that the finding was contrary to the evidence, contrary to law, and that improper evidence had been admitted. The motion was denied.</p>
    <p id="b725-7" data-blocks='[["BL_725.7",725,[121,1669,750,331]]]'>On April 30, 1942 appellee, as plaintiff, filed a second suit against appellant in the Small Claims Branch of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia for the sum of $35.72 “for annual sewer and water assessment for the years 1941 and 1942 which the defendant assumed to pay on the property” (describing said premises).</p>
    <p id="b725-8" data-blocks='[["BL_725.8",725,[121,2009,750,790]]]'>Upon the hearing of this case the payment by appellee of two installments of the assessment amounting to $17.36 each was admitted. Each party relied upon the stenographic record and the judgment in Case No. 397,249. No additional evidence was offered. Appellee’s position was, and now is, that in the prior suit there had been an adjudication of his right to be reimbursed subsequent annual payments of the assessment. Appellant by his plea to the complaint claimed that the judgment in the former suit constituted an estoppel against a second action for breach of the contract, and on this defense he now relies. Appellant’s plea was denied by the trial court and judgment was entered for the amount claimed. From this judgment we allowed an appeal.</p>
    <p id="b725-9" data-blocks='[["BL_725.9",725,[909,292,750,377]]]'>In the reporter’s transcript, it appears that defendant in the first action denied liability for any part of the charge for improvements upon various grounds. Also that he claimed that appellee had not been damaged beyond the $17.36 paid by him, as he might “move away tomorrow” or sell the property and not pay the $404.00 then due to redeem the amount (R. 42, 43).</p>
    <p id="b725-10" data-blocks='[["BL_725.10",725,[906,680,749,409]]]'>The judgment record in Case No. 397,249 does not show the basis for the allowance of the sum of $17.36. The trial judge in the first action advised the judge presiding at the trial of the present case “that the finding in that case was limited to $17.36, only for the reason that the accrued assessments had amounted to that amount and no more, at the time of the findings in that case.”</p>

This was held to be a valid cause of action by the U. S. Court of Appeals. In the case before it that court upheld the contention that the entire cost of the improvements was recoverable in a single action for damages for breach of the contract. We regard this decision as conclusive upon us of the fact that as plaintiff in Case No. 397,249 appellee was entitled to recover an amount sufficient to indemnify him for future installments of the assessment. That the trial court in appellee’s first action adopted a different view and misconstrued his measure of damage is immaterial. His remedy was by appeal from that judgment; not in the filing of a second suit.</p>

The defense was that plaintiff, at the time of suit, had paid but one installment. The court held that the defendant had breached the contract <a id="p678" href="#p678" data-label="678" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*678</a>by his failure to pay the one installment when it matured and that: “The fact that the plaintiff’s absolute obligation may not require to be discharged until a future day at most could entitle the defendant only to a discount for prepayment.”</p>

A deferred item of $2,000.00 was objected to “on the grounds that it was -not pleaded, and that it did not accrue until after the commencement of the action”. Although included in the original judgment it was eliminated by stipulation and the judgment modified accordingly. A second action was filed for its recovery and judgment given for the amount. In reversing this judgment the court said: “An action for wrongful discharge may include every element of damage arising from the discharge. It is an indivisible action, and one recovery is a bar to any further action for damages.”</p>
