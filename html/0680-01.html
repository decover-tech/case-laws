The company tendered the return of $49.20, being the total amount of premiums paid in. This was rejected and suit commenced on the policy. At the trial plaintiffs proved the policy and the death of the insured, and rested.</p>

    <p id="b729-7" data-blocks='[["BL_729.7",729,[119,1381,748,794]]]'>A physician called by the defendant testified, in substance, that a patient with the symptoms and in the physical condition revealed by the history of the insured was in fact suffering from a serious disease; that it would prevent her from pursuing her normal everyday occupation and had, in fact, incapacitated this patient; that the various bone changes were permanent, although she might from time to time regain the use of the affected parts; that the ailment would tend to become progressively worse and she would finally become bedridden. His testimony was further that the patient would be bound to know she had a serious disease because of the excruciating pain she would suffer, the long periods of time spent in the hospital, and the incapacitating effect of the ailment.</p>

He testified that in the early summer of 1937 she was almost totally incapacitated by arthritis; that he had treated her with some success; and that he placed her in the hospital not because she was actually in need of hospitalization but because he was treating her with sulfa drugs and wanted to keep her under observation. He testified that the ailment was serious only in the sense that it temporarily restricted the motion of certain parts of the body; that it was an illness that would, and did, leave the patient as quickly as it had come upon her; that her condition would not be permanent, and that any incapacity would be of a temporary nature; that the arthritis from which she was suffering was not dangerous to life and that it would not, and did not, shorten her life; and that the patient had made a “perfectly marvelous” recovery after she left the hospital in April, 1938, and was able to do ordinary household tasks.</p>

The two physicians who testified for the respective parties offered sharply contradictory views on the medical aspects of the case. Furthermore, the physician of the insured directly rebutted defendant’s contention that insured had either real or imputed knowledge of the alleged seriousness of her condition. Further substantial contradiction on this point came from the two lay witnesses.</p>

Co. of America, 1941, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20App.%20D.C.%20197" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="74 App. D.C. 197">74 App.D.C. 197</a>, <a href="/f2d/121/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="121 F.2d 110" data-case-ids="463142" data-case-paths="/f2d/121/0110-01">121 F.2d 110</a>. It is, however, equally well established that where plaintiff creates a substantial issue of fact on the question of unsound health, it becomes a question for the jury and not for the court. Healy v.

And in determining a motion of either party for a peremptory instruction, the court assumes that the evidence for the opposing party proves all that it reasonably may be found sufficient to establish, and that from such facts there should be drawn in favor of the latter all the inferences that fairly are deducible from them. [Citations] Where uncertainty as to the existence of negligence arises from a conflict in the testimony or because, the facts being undisputed, fair-minded men will honestly draw different conclusions from them, the question is not one of law but of fact to be settled by the jury.
