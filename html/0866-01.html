    <p id="b914-28" data-blocks='[["BL_914.29",914,[1048,1903,749,539]]]'>This action for possession of an apartment was instituted by appellee as plaintiff in the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the Municipal Court. The complaint alleged that defendant was occupying apartment No. 407 in the Harwill Apartments, 1835 K Street, N. W., holding over under a lease which had expired, and that the plaintiff, owner of the building, sought in good faith to recover possession for her immediate and personal use and occupancy as a dwelling. Defendant’s plea denied the allegation of good faith.</p>
    <p id="b914-29" data-blocks='[["BL_914.30",914,[1049,2453,746,117]]]'>Trial was by the court; a finding for plaintiff and judgment for possession resulted.</p>

She had lived, and continues <a id="p867" href="#p867" data-label="867" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*867</a>to live, at Edgewater, Maryland, 35 miles from Washington. Her husband managed the apartment building and conducted a real estate and insurance business in a room on the first floor.</p>

There were then no vacant apartments in the building. After September 1st another apartment was vacated but it was not of the type desired by plaintiff.</p>

    <p id="b915-8" data-blocks='[["BL_915.7",915,[105,1290,749,614]]]'>Defendant testified that in August plaintiff’s husband told him that plaintiff wanted the apartment vacated; that the apartment was occupied by defendant’s estranged wife and the reason given for the request to vacate was that her conduct as occupant was objectionable. Nothing then was said about plaintiff wanting the premises for her own occupancy. When the notice was served on September 1, giving a different reason for desiring possession, plaintiff’s husband said that the owner had to give the ground stated in the notice to get the occupant out of possession.</p>

This provision was considered under comparable circumstances in our opinion in the case of Shaffer v. Bowes, D.C.Mun.App., <a href="/a2d/31/0690-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="31 A.2d 690" data-case-ids="8153042" data-case-paths="/a2d/31/0690-01">31 A.2d 690</a>. We held that the Act “did not intend to prevent an owner from occupying his own premises, provided such • occupancy is sought in good faith and not for the purpose of evading or defeating the purposes of the Act. In such circumstances, where an owner has several properties available, the choice of which one he shall occupy is for "him.”</p>

But no one, or all in combination, necessarily constitute bad faith. They are items of evidence, to be considered by the court with the other evidence in the case.</p>
