The sale price of the ring was $400, payable in weekly instal-ments of $5. The conditional sale agreement was executed by Mrs. Sacchino who signed her name as Evelyn Kent. Mrs. Kent is the sister of Mrs. Sacchino.</p>
    <p id="b906-26" data-blocks='[["BL_906.27",906,[1025,1591,752,901]]]'>Sometime thereafter Mrs. Sacchino delivered the ring to her husband in order that he might obtain money on it with which to pay their rent. Mr. Sacchino took the ring to James K. Hughes, an attorney who had represented him in several cases involving charges of false pretenses, and offered it for sale to Mr. Hughes. The latter declined to buy but offered to sell it for Sacchino. The two went to the store of Max Zweig, the appellant herein, operator of a second-hand store and a licensed junk dealer, who had been buying diamonds for many years. Sacchino did not go in the store but waited outside. Hughes went in the store and asked Zweig what he could get for the ring; Zweig examined the ring and offered Hughes $75 for it, which Hughes accepted. Hughes took the money to Sacchino and they together went to a real estate office and paid Sacchino’s rent.</p>

With respect to it, some doubt was raised as to whether the transaction was a pawn or a sale, but Hughes stated definitely it was a sale. <a id="p859" href="#p859" data-label="859" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*859</a>Zweig testified that he had known Hughes for a number of years, but denied'buying the ring in question or any other ring from Hughes. The case was tried by the court without a jury and the trial judge found as a fact that the ring in question was delivered by Hughes to Zweig. This finding is supported by substantial evidence and we accept it.</p>
    <p id="b907-4" data-blocks='[["BL_907.5",907,[92,638,747,247]]]'>Schwartz &amp; Son brought the action below for the recovery of the ring or the value thereof from both Hughes and Zweig. A judgment for $314 was rendered against Zweig alone and from that judgment this appeal was taken.</p>

The trial court ruled that possession only was transferred to Mrs. Sac-chino, that by reason of her fraudulent representations she obtained no better title than a thief, and consequently failure to record the instrument would not have the effect of protecting even an innocent purchaser for value. In this we think the trial court was in error.</p>

On the reverse side of the conditional sale agreement was a form of application containing spaces for information regarding the prospective purchaser, but this application was left blank. While no case in this District directly in point has been found, there are cases which we believe recognize the principle first stated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In support of the trial court’s ruling, appellees cite a number of authorities,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> but those authorities deal with situations where possession alone was delivered and no sale intended. Here ap-pellees plainly intended to make a sale, a conditional one but nevertheless a sale. We think the transaction between the ap-pellees and Mrs. Sacchino was voidable but not void.</p>

The trial judge, while not basing his decision squarely on this point, did hold that the circumstances of the sale to Zweig were sufficient to put him upon inquiry. Those circumstances were that Hughes went to Zweig, whom he had known for several years, and asked Zweig how much money he could get for the ring, that Zweig made no inquiry as to whom the ring belonged but examined it briefly and offered $75 which Hughes accepted. According to appellees’ testimony, this ring was of a value of $400, and while Zweig denied ever having seen the ring, upon a description of it being given to him, stated in his opinion it would have a value of $200. Can it be said, as a matter of law, under these circumstances, that Zweig had notice of, or should have been put upon inquiry as to, the conditional sale agreement? Zweig was a second-hand dealer and it is common knowledge that those engaged in that trade do not pay full value for articles nor do prospective sellers expect full value. Zweig, of course, expected to resell at a profit and he naturally began negotiations by making his lowest offer. This offer was promptly accepted by Hughes. Perhaps Zweig thought he was getting a bargain, but should this make him suspicious? It should be noted that this was not the instance of a total stranger offering a diamond for sale, but the offer was made by a member of the bar whom Zweig had known for several years. There is nothing in the record to indicate any reason why Zweig should suspect that Hughes would offer for sale an article which he did not have the right to sell. Indeed, the trial court found that Hughes’ action was- entirely innocent.</p>
