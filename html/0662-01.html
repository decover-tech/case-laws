Knott, for the recovery of alleged usurious interest. The record discloses that in February, 1937, Mr. Jackson sought a loan from Dr. Knott and offered as security a third deed of trust on his home, but the loan was refused on the ground the security offered was insufficient. Later Mr. Jackson, with the consent of his aunt, Isabell Ware, again approached Dr. Knott and offered a second deed of trust on Mrs. Ware’s house as additional security for the loan. Dr. Knott examined her house and approved a loan. The record does not disclose the amount of the loan originally sought nor the amount finally agreed upon but on March 10, 1937 Mr. and Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Ware executed a joint and several note, payable to the order of Marie Toombs, in the principal amount of $980, with interest at 6% per annum, principal and interest being payable in monthly installments of $40 each. This note was secured by a single deed of trust executed by the three makers of the note and covering both the Jackson and Ware homes.</p>

The latter amount was advanced by Dr. Knott in the following amounts and for the following purposes: a check for $112.50 to Mr. Sager as payment on a second trust on the property of the Jacksons, a check for $120.00 to the Bank of Commerce &amp; Savings in payment of a debt of Mr. Jackson, a check for $37.43 to L. P. Stewart to pay a bill owed by Mr. Jackson, checks for $72.74 and $65.01 in payment of taxes on the Jacksons’ property, a check for $68.06 in payment of taxes on the Ware property, a check for $209.19 in payment of a bill owing by Mrs. Ware, and the balance in cash which was handed to Mrs. Jackson. The record offers no explanation why the payments were made in the manner above stated rather than by one check to the plaintiffs, though apparently it was by agreement of all parties.</p>

The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs in the sum of $330.82. This sum was arrived at by adding the sum of $98.72, the interest charged on the note, and the principal amount of $980, making -a total of $1,078.72, and deducting therefrom $697.90, the amount actually advanced, plus the $50 payment to Miller.</p>

We think the trial court was correct in this ruling. The Loan Shark Law is not a usury statute, but an act licensing, under limitations and restrictions, the lending of money in .small sums upon personal security;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">2</a> and was intended to apply only to persons making small loans upon personal security as shown by the fact that the amount of such loans is limited by the act to $200.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The actual amount loaned in this case, nearly $700, can hardly be called a small loan and is far above the figure fixed by the act.</p>

Such evidence, plus the making of the loan here in issue, is not sufficient to warrant a finding that Knott was engaged “in the business of loaning money” within the meaning of the act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Plaintiff also offered in evidence other notes payable to Marie Toombs but since the witness testified that -Marie Toombs lent money herself, the court properly refused to admit those notes in evidence against Knott.</p>

And in some of the cases it is held that where one joint maker pays all the illegal interest he may sue therefore in a separate action without joining his co-maker as a co-plaintiff. But such cases, in our opinion, do not sustain the proposition that joint makers of a note may not maintain a joint suit for recovery of usury. Plainly one joint maker should not be allowed to recover that which he did not pay, since his co-maker, not being a party to the action, might also sue and thus force defendant to pay twice for the same usury. In the present case, all parties to the note are in court and defendant cannot be prejudiced by a joint judgment. One determination of the usury paid has been made, and one judgment entered. Defendant will be compelled to pay that judgment and no more.</p>

The father and sons joined in an action to recover double the amount of the illegal interest as provided by the Texas statute. The trial court ruled that there was -a variance between the allegations and proof but this ruling was reversed on appeal, where the court said:</p>

Nor did the separate payments by any one of them release him from his joint and several liability for the balance due. The note being joint and several, so far as the payee was concerned, he could hold all the makers jointly and severally liable for the full amount, regardless of the payments each one had made, and any agreement relative to the division of liability thereon by the appellants inter se could not affect the question. So that in our judgment it necessarily follows that any payment made by one of the plaintiffs inured to the benefit of all, and was in law a payment by all of them; and this was but the effect of the allegation in plaintiffs’ petition and the proof fully conformed thereto, so that there was not, in our judgment, any variance. The judgment of the court instructing a verdict for the defendant on the ground of a variance was error, for which the judgment must be reversed.”</blockquote>

While Mrs. Jackson actually made no payments on the note, she was jointly and severally liable thereon, property owned by her and her husband was given as security for the payment of the loan and she was in all respects an essential party to the note. We conclude under these circumstances the three joint makers had the right to maintain a joint suit and to obtain a joint judgment for the usury admittedly paid, even though they could not show exactly what amount each had individually paid.</p>

Appellant’s position in this regard is that Mrs. Ware, upon the payment of $300, was finally released from all obligation under the note, and that as a consequence her claim is barred by the limitation of the act. As previously stated, when Mrs. Ware made the $300 payment in March, 1939, her property was released from the deed of trust. It does not necessarily follow, however, that she was released from further obligation under the note. There was no evidence that she made the payment in order to be released from personal liability or that Knott agreed that she would be released upon making the payment, or that he told her at any time that she was released. He gave her no writing to that effect and it is significant that, while the note bore an endorsement by the trustee that the Ware property was released from the deed of trust securing the note, there was no notation made upon the note of any release of personal liability of Mrs. Ware.. The only evidence regarding a release of Mrs. Ware from further liability on the note is her testimony that when she paid the $300 she was “finished”, and that thereafter she was asked for no further payments, and Dr. Knott’s testimony that when the $300 payment was made he cancelled the signature of Mrs. Ware by drawing a line through it, but he did not testify that he did that in the presence of Mrs. Ware or that he did it for the purpose of releasing her from further liability. The original note, produced here under Rule 32(c), discloses an indistinct line drawn through Mrs. Ware’s signature. Dr. Knott testified that he drew lines through the other two signatures when the note was finally paid, that he presumed all the lines were made with the same ink and the same pen and that he was using the same ink in 1941 that he used in 1939. Under these circumstances, we think it was proper for the, trial court to submit to the jury the question, as hereinafter discussed, of whether or not Dr. Knott had actually released Mrs. Ware from further personal liability on the note at the time she made the $300 payment.</p>

By its verdict the jury found that she was not released and that the charge was proper. We think these two questions were properly submitted to the jury. The evidence as to what transpired at the time of the making of the $300 payment was neither positive nor direct. From such evidence the jury might have found, as evidently it did, that the purpose of the $300 payment was to obtain a release of Mrs. Ware’s property from the deed of trust and not to obtain a release from further personal obligation on the note. As to the $50 charge, Miller testified that it was a payment to him for handling the transaction, including the preparation of the note and deed of trust and recording charges, and the record states that on cross-examination he itemized the figures making up that amount. As far as the record discloses, these charges were not excessive nor made as a cloak for usury, and the jury, by its verdict, found this to be a proper charge against the plaintiffs.</p>
