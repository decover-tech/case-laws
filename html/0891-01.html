    <p id="b940-16" data-blocks='[["BL_940.17",940,[235,2166,746,411]]]'>Appellant, Rufus Penwell, was charged in the Criminal Division of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia with violations of sections 301 (e) and 609 (a), Title 40, of the District of Columbia Code (1940 Ed.), such offenses being commonly known as “driving without a permit” and “leaving after colliding”. Trial was had before the court without a jury and defendant was found guilty of both charges.</p>

One Dean testified that he was standing near the scene of the accident and saw the collision, that there were two men in the automobile which collided with Thomas’ car but that he did not observe the driver of that automobile, that after the collision he saw a man talking with Thomas but this man was not the defendant, that after the accident he saw a man whom he identified as the defendant get into the automobile and drive it away. There was evidence that the colliding car, which bore Maryland tags, was registered in the name of and owned by the defendant and that defendant had neither a District of Columbia nor Maryland operator’s permit.</p>
    <p id="b940-19" data-blocks='[["BL_940.20",940,[1017,1360,752,785]]]'>Defendant admitted he owned an automobile which bore the Maryland tag number identified as being on the colliding car and admitted he had no permit to operate the car, but testified that on the day of the accident the car was in a garage where defendant was employed, denied that he was driving the car at the time of the accident, and testified that at the time of the accident he was at his home in Maryland with his wife, his sister and his brother-in-law. Defendant’s wife and sister corroborated his testimony that he was at home at the time the accident occurred, though defendant’s sister testified the car was in defendant’s yard in Maryland that day rather than in the garage in the District of Columbia where defendant worked, as defendant had testified.</p>

The prosecution called as a witness a police officer, who testified that he interviewed the defendant and defendant denied he had been the driver of the car or had been in the car at the time of the accident. Over objection of the defendant the officer was permitted to testify that he had been informed a Mr. and Mrs. Bryan had witnessed the accident, that Mr. and Mrs. Bryan were called to the office of the Accident Investigation Unit and there in the <a id="p893" href="#p893" data-label="893" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*893</a>presence of the witness and defendant Mr. and Mrs. Bryan “positively identified” the defendant as the driver of the car. This testimony was admitted by the trial judge on the theory that the statements had been made in the presence of the defendant and having drawn no reply or denial from him were therefore competent as admissions by silence on the part of the defendant. Later during the trial the judge took the position that such evidence was not admissible and refused to permit the defendant to be cross-examined concerning the identification by Mr. and Mrs. Bryan. In rendering his decision the trial judge stated that he was disregarding the testimony objected to and that his finding was based on the other testimony adduced at the trial. Mr. and Mrs. Bryan were not produced as witnesses and the record discloses no explanation for their absence.</p>
