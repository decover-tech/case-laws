    <p id="b910-7" data-blocks='[["BL_910.8",910,[259,691,746,408]]]'>On September 8, 1942 plaintiff below obtained a judgment for possession of real estate. No appeal was taken from that judgment, but on October 12, 1942, defendant below filed a motion to set aside the judgment and grant a new trial. On November 5, 1942 an order was entered denying that motion, and on November 12, 1942 defendant filed notice of appeal from that order.</p>

    <p id="b910-9" data-blocks='[["BL_910.10",910,[257,1249,746,623]]]'>We have before us the complete record on appeal and are in a position to decide the fundamental question presented by ap-pellee’s motion. The record discloses that the motion to set aside the judgment and grant a new trial is predicated upon alleged errors occurring at the trial of the case, does not involve subsequently occurring or later discovered facts, and makes no charge that the judgment was entered as a result of fraud, accident or mistake. In other words, all matters sought to be raised by the motion could have been reviewed by timely appeal from the original judgment, had one been noted.</p>

When the right of appeal has been lost, the unsuccessful party cannot reinvest himself with that right by filing a motion of this nature.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
