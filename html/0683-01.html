Trial by jury was demanded by plaintiff and the case was set for trial on Tuesday, October 27, 1942. On that day parties and their counsel were present in court at 10 a. m. but the case was not reached until about 3 p. m. At that time a “long panel” of jurors was not available but both sides agreed to accept a “short panel” of twelve jurors. Apparently one of the twelve was disqualified or excused, since by agreement the jury sworn to try the case consisted of only eleven members.</p>

The court announced that trial would commence and go as far as possible that afternoon, and be resumed again on Thursday. Plaintiff’s counsel stated this was satisfactory to him.

After some discussion between counsel and court as to the number of witnesses yet to testify the court stated it thought the case could be finished by 5 o’clock Thursday and counsel for plaintiff assented.</p>

Counsel for' defendant objected to such a continuance, and the court stated that after so long an adjournment the jury would forget the testimony already given. Counsel for defendants suggested plaintiff should take a nonsuit but plaintiff’s counsel refused to do so. After some discussion the court asked plaintiff’s counsel if he did not think a nonsuit should be taken and again plaintiff’s counsel refused. Finally the court announced that the trial would be resumed on the following morning. Counsel for plaintiff announced that he would not be present, that his arrangement for leaving the city had been made and he was leaving at 6:30; and he returned to the criminal trial then in progress in the District Court. The court excused the jury which had returned at 1:30 and instructed them to return the following morning at 10 o’clock.</p>

It may be that plaintiff’s counsel could not have anticipated the criminal case would not be completed on Wednesday, but the fact is he made a definite statement that he would be available on Thursday and the plans of all others engaged in the trial were adjusted on the basis of that statement. When counsel and court met on Thursday at 1:30 and plaintiff’s counsel was still engaged in the criminal case the court did not insist that the trial of this case resume at its scheduled time but postponed it until the following day when counsel for the plaintiff would have completed his engagement in the District Court. The only ground for plaintiff’s request for a continuance was his previously made engagement to go to Indiana for the elections. No doubt.this was a matter of importance to counsel, but it may well be assumed that the court, opposing counsel, the defendants, and the jurors likewise had matters of importance to them. Had the case been postponed a week it would have required the jurors being brought back to court after they had completed their usual term of service, because such postponement would have carried over into the following month. It was the duty of the trial court to weigh and consider the plans and convenience of all parties concerned, and not that of plaintiff’s counsel alone. The defendants had the right to urge that the trial be completed promptly. All these things we must assume the trial court considered and we cannot say that its action in ordering the trial to resume on Friday morning was an abuse of discretion. The question before us is not whether the trial court should have granted the continuance, for that is a matter left to the judgment of the trial court and not the appellate court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Our inquiry must be limited to whether the trial court abused the discretion vested in it, and we find no such abuse.</p>

On the preceding day counsel for plaintiff had emphatically stated that he would not be present, and, when asked by counsel for defendant if he wished his client to make any response when court opened on Friday, counsel for plaintiff replied, “The record shows my response.” The trial court was justified in assuming that plaintiff’s absence on Friday was due to the absence of his counsel. There is nothing in the record to indicate otherwise, nor was any other explanation offered to the trial judge during or after the trial. After this appeal was noted there were filed affidavits of plaintiff, plaintiff’s counsel and a member of the bar who was not counsel in the case. Plaintiff’s affidavit is to the effect that he was not present in court on Friday, when trial resumed, because of illness. Accompanying his affidavit was a physician’s certificate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> These affidavits were never presented to the trial court and this court cannot consider them. “We sit to correct errors of the trial court.

Before the day’s proceedings were over appellant’s counsel told the judge that he had made his plans to leave the city two days hence (on Thursday evening) and could not change them. (We should take judicial notice of the difficulty in obtaining traveling accommodations and the even greater difficulty of changing them at the last minute.) Counsel also told the judge that he would be required to be in the District Court the following morning. That engagement he was of course powerless to prevent. But for that engagement he could have completed the case on Wednesday. Moreover there is in the record the court’s statement that it could not resume the case on Thursday morning; so that even if appellant’s counsel had been free to finish the case on Thursday morning the court could not have heard it. Finding himself in that troublesome situation, appellant’s counsel made a fruitless effort to obtain a substitute lawyer to complete the case. Even if he had succeeded there would still be the practical and psychological disadvantage to appellant of having a new lawyer take over the case in the middle of the trial.</p>
    <p id="b734-18" data-blocks='[["BL_734.15",734,[1017,2018,744,286]]]'>It seems to me that the judge should have considered the practical result of refusing a continuance and should have seen that it would deprive appellant of his day in court and would result in no trial worthy of the name. Furthermore these alternatives were open to the judge:</p>

This was refused because the judge appeared to have other cases on that day. The only other reason given was <a id="p687" href="#p687" data-label="687" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*687</a>the expense of bringing the jury back. This means nothing because it would have cost no more to bring them back on one day than on another. Nor is there anything to the argument that the jury would be inclined to forget what they had heard; even if that were true, the disadvantage would have been to appellant, because it was he who was plaintiff below.</p>
    <p id="b735-5" data-blocks='[["BL_735.4",735,[134,662,746,282]]]'>2. At the time of the conference in chambers the judge could have ordered a mistrial. This would have resulted in discharging the particular jury before which it had been commenced and having the case reset for trial before a new jury at some later date.</p>
    <p id="b735-6" data-blocks='[["BL_735.5",735,[134,963,746,323]]]'>3. The trial judge could at that time have ordered an involuntary nonsuit instead of attempting to coax appellant into taking a voluntary nonsuit. This would have been tantamount to a dismissal without prejudice, with all costs against appellant, but with the important right reserved to him to re-file his case.</p>
    <p id="b735-7" data-blocks='[["BL_735.6",735,[131,1307,749,861]]]'>4. On the critical Friday morning when plaintiff’s attorney could not be there and when plaintiff was unable to secure another lawyer and did not appear at the trial (there is at least some evidence that he was ill) it was still not too late for the court to save the situation. It could then have ordered a continuance, or á mistrial, or a nonsuit. Finally, if the court felt ■that plaintiff had abandoned the case, the logical step would have been to order a dismissal for want of prosecution. Such dismissal would have carried costs against the plaintiff, and would have avoided the inherent injustice of the ex parte proceeding which resulted. But the court ignored the comparative benefits of these possible steps and adhered to its determination that the case be tried that day. That is what I think constitutes error, and demands correction here.</p>
    <p id="b735-8" data-blocks='[["BL_735.7",735,[131,2190,748,409]]]'>I am not overlooking the desirability of ■obtaining prompt disposition of cases and of protecting litigants and witnesses from unnecessary delays. But even these important considerations must give way when the alternative result is no trial at all. Contests of will power between counsel and court are always unfortunate; the contestants are not evenly matched, and the judge usually prevails.</p>

Nor is it a case where a lawyer has merely been forced to trial before he was prepared. It is a case where the judge selected the only day when counsel could not be present as the <em>one </em>day when the trial must be completed.</p>
