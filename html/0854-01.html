Both were private passenger cars. The accident occurred at noon, the day was clear, the street dry. The only other traffic noted was a southbound truck on 26th Street, north of I Street. There were neither traffic signs nor signals at this corner.</p>
    <p id="b902-34" data-blocks='[["BL_902.35",902,[1017,2008,751,329]]]'>Plaintiff was driving north on 26th Street; defendant east on I Street. Plaintiff testified that he was driving about 25 miles per hour; that as he approached the intersection he took his foot off the accelerator but did not apply his brakes; that at the time of the impact his speed was 25 to 30 miles per hour.</p>

There was a southbound truck on 26th Street, north of I Street, whifch stopped and the driver waved him on.

He did look to his left, saw a truck stop, and saw the driver wave him on. He did not see plaintiff’s car until it was 20 feet from the intersection — where his own car was at that time he does not state. Until then he did not attempt to apply his brakes or slacken his speed. As he was presumably driving on the south side of I Street, that part which plaintiff’s car would first enter, a collision was then practically inevitable.</p>
